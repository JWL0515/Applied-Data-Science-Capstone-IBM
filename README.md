# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM

This repo is for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. This is final project.

## Project Background
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefor if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. With public information and machine learning models we can predict, if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

## Problems to be solved
- The relationships between variables and how they can have impact on outcome.
- What are the best conditions for the successful landing.
- Which machine learning models are better for this case.

## Methodology

- Data collection methodology:
  - SpaceX REST API
  - Web Scrapping from Wikipedia
- erform data wrangling:
  -Data clean
  - Use One-Hot-Encoding for numeric variables
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
- Perform interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
- Perform predictive analysis using classification models
